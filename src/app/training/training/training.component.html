                                     <p>Insurance companies play an important role in a country’s economic development. They are contributing in a significant sense to ensuring that the wealth of the country is protected and preserved. Some of their contributions are given below.</p>
                                     <ol>

	<li>These funds are collected and held for the benefit of the policyholders.

	<li>The system of insurance provides numerous direct and indirect benefits to the individual, his family, to industry and commerce and to the community and the nation as a whole. The insured - both individuals and enterprises - are directly benefitted because they are protected from the consequences of the loss that may be caused by an accident or fortuitous event. Insurance, thus, in a sense protects the capital in industry and releases the capital for further expansion and development of business and</li>
	<li>Insurance removes the fear, worry and anxiety associated with one’s future and thus encourages free investment of capital in business enterprises and promotes efficient use of existing resources. Thus insurance encourages commercial and industrial development along with generation of employment opportunities, thereby contributing to a healthy economy and increased national</li>
	<li>A bank or financial institution may not advance loans on property unless it is insured against loss or damage by insurable perils. Most of them insist on assigning the policy as collateral</li>
	<li>Before acceptance of a risk, insurers arrange survey and inspection of the property to be insured, by qualified engineers and other experts. They not only assesses the risk for rating purposes but also suggest and recommend to the insured, various improvements in the risk, which will attract lower rates of</li>
	<li>Insurance ranks with export trade, shipping and banking services as an earner of foreign exchange to the country. Indian insurers operate in more than 30 countries. These operations earn foreign exchange and represent invisible.</li>

	<li>It is now recognised that provision of social security is an obligation of the State. Various laws, passed by the State for this purpose involve use of insurance, compulsory or voluntary, as a tool of social security. Central and State Governments contribute premiums under certain social security schemes thus fulfilling their social commitments. The Employees State Insurance Act, 1948 provides for&nbsp;<strong>Employees State Insurance Corporation&nbsp;</strong>to pay for the expenses of sickness, disablement, maternity and death for the benefit of industrial employees and their families, who are insured persons. The scheme operates in certain industrial areas as notified by the Government.</li>
	<li>Insurers play an important role in social security schemes sponsored by the Government such as
	<ol>
		<li>RKBY – Rashtriya Krishi Bima Yojana</li>
		<li>RSBY – Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana</li>
		<li>PMJBY – Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana</li>
		<li>PMSBY – Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana All these benefit the community in</li>

<ol>
	<li>All the&nbsp;<strong>rural insurance schemes</strong>, operated on a commercial basis, are designed ultimately to provide social security to the rural</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>Apart from this support to Government schemes, the insurance industry itself offers on a commercial basis, insurance covers which have the ultimate objective of social security. Examples are:&nbsp;<strong>Janata Personal Accident, Jan Arogya</strong></li>

                           <p><strong>Risk</strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><strong>peril</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>hazard</strong>&nbsp;are terms used to indicate the possibility of loss, and are often used interchangeably, but the insurance industry distinguishes these terms. A&nbsp;risk&nbsp;is simply the possibility of a loss, but a&nbsp;<strong>peril</strong>&nbsp;is a cause of loss. A&nbsp;<strong>hazard</strong>&nbsp;is a condition that increases the possibility of loss. For instance, fire is a peril because it causes losses, while a fireplace is a hazard because it increases the probability of loss from fire. Some things can be both a peril and a hazard. Smoking, for instance, causes cancer and other health ailments, while also increasing the probability of such ailments. Many fundamental risks, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or unemployment, that affect many people are generally insured by society or by the government, while particular risks that affect individuals or specific organizations, such as losses from fire or vandalism, are considered the particular responsibilities of those affected.</p>


                           <h3>Types of Risk</h3>
                          <p>There are different types of risks — only some are preventable, and only certain types of risk are&nbsp;insurable. Risk can be categorized as to what causes the risk, and to whom it affects.</p>
                          <p><strong>Pure risk</strong>&nbsp;is a risk in which there is only a possibility of loss or no loss—there is no possibility of gain. Pure risk can be categorized as personal, property, or legal risk. Pure risk is insurable, because the&nbsp;law of large numbers&nbsp;can be applied to estimate future losses, which allows&nbsp;insurance companies&nbsp;to calculate what&nbsp;premium to charge&nbsp;based on expected losses.</p>


                          	<p>Static and dynamic risks are distinguished by their temporality. The possibility of loss is uniform over an extended period of time for&nbsp;<strong>static risks</strong>, so static risks are more predictable, and, therefore, more insurable.&nbsp;<strong>Dynamic risks</strong>&nbsp;change with time, making them less predictable and less insurable. For instance, the&nbsp;risk of unemployment&nbsp;changes with the economy, so it is difficult to predict what unemployment will be next year. On the other hand, the number of houses that burn down within a given year within a specific geographical area is steadier, not cyclical, and so is more predictable.</p>


                          	<p><strong>Personal risks</strong>&nbsp;are risks that affect someone directly, such as illness, disability, or death.&nbsp;<strong>Property risk</strong>&nbsp;affects either personal or real property. Thus, a house fire or car theft are examples of property risk. A property loss often involves both a direct loss and consequential losses. A&nbsp;<strong>direct loss</strong>&nbsp;is the loss or damage to the property itself. A&nbsp;<strong>consequential loss</strong>&nbsp;(aka&nbsp;<strong>indirect loss</strong>) is a loss created by the direct loss. Thus, if your car is stolen, that is a direct loss; if you have to rent a car because of the theft, then you have some financial loss—a consequential loss—from renting a car.</p>

                          	<p>Legal risk&nbsp;(aka&nbsp;<strong>liability risk</strong>) is a particular type of personal risk that you will be sued because of neglect, malpractice, or causing willful injury either to another person or to someone else's property. Legal risk is the possibility of financial loss if you are found liable, or the financial loss incurred just defending yourself, even if you are not found liable. Most personal, property, and legal risks are insurable.</p>


                          	<p><strong>Speculative risk</strong>&nbsp;differs from pure risk because there is the possibility of profit or loss, such as investing in financial markets. Most speculative risks are uninsurable, because they are undertaken willingly for the hope of profit. Also, speculative risk will generally involve a greater frequency of loss than a pure risk, since profit is the only other possibility. So although many people take precautions to protect their lives or their property, they willingly engage in speculative risks, such as investing in the stock market, to make a profit; otherwise, a person could avoid most speculative risks simply by avoiding the activity that gives rise to it.</p>


                          	<p>The speculative risk of investments can also be distinguished as&nbsp;systemic risk&nbsp;(a.k.a.&nbsp;<strong>systematic risk</strong>) or&nbsp;<strong>diversifiable risk</strong>&nbsp;(a.k.a.&nbsp;<strong>unsystematic risk</strong>). Systemic risk affects the whole economy, causing the value of many financial instruments to lose value. Diversifiable risk, on the other hand, affects only specific investments, such as particular stocks or particular assets. It is called a diversifiable risk because this risk can be minimized by diversifying investments, by not putting all your eggs in one basket. By contrast, systemic risk cannot be diversified away, because it affects almost all investments. Systemic risk can be minimized if the investments are diversified and held long enough, since the value of most investments, like businesses, goes through cycles.</p>


                          	<p>Unlike pure risk, where there is only possibility of a loss, society benefits from speculative risks. For instance, investments benefit society, and starting a business helps to create jobs and generate tax revenue for society, and can lead to economic growth, or even technological advancement.</p>


                          	<p>Risk can also be classified as to whether it affects many people or only a single individual.&nbsp;<strong>Fundamental risk</strong>&nbsp;is a risk, such as an earthquake or terrorism, that can affect many people at once.&nbsp;<strong>Economic risks</strong>, such as unemployment, are also fundamental risks because they affect many people.&nbsp;<strong>Particular risk</strong>&nbsp;is a risk that affects particular individuals, such as robbery or vandalism. Insurance companies generally insure some fundamental risks, such as hurricane or wind damage, and most particular risks. In the case of fundamental risks that are insured, insurance companies help to reduce their risk of great financial loss by limiting coverage in a specific geographic area and by the use of&nbsp;reinsurance, which is the purchase of insurance from other companies to cover their potential losses. However, private insurers do not insure many fundamental risks, such as unemployment. These risks are generally insured by the government, because the government has some control over economic risks through specific policies, such as&nbsp;monetary policy, and law. Fundamental and particular risks can be pure or speculative risks.</p>


                          	<p>Fundamental risks are risks that affect many members of society, but fundamental risks can also affect organizations. For instance,&nbsp;<strong>enterprise risk</strong>&nbsp;is the set of all risks that affects a business enterprise. Speculative risks that can affect an organization are usually subdivided into strategic risk, operational risk, and financial risk.&nbsp;<strong>Strategic risk</strong>&nbsp;results from goal-oriented behavior. A business may want to try to improve efficiency by buying new equipment or trying a new technique, but may result in more losses than gains.&nbsp;<strong>Operational risks</strong>&nbsp;arise from the operation of the enterprise, such as the risk of injury to employees, or the risk that customers' data can be leaked to the public because of insufficient security.&nbsp;<strong>Financial risk</strong>&nbsp;is the risk that an investment will result in losses. Because most enterprise risk is speculative risk, and because the enterprise itself can do much to lower its own risk, many companies are learning to manage their risk by creating departments and hiring people with the express purpose of reducing enterprise risks—enterprise risk management. Many larger firms may have a&nbsp;<strong>chief risk officer</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>CRO</strong>) with the primary responsibility of reducing risk throughout the enterprise.</p>

                        	<p>Risk is the chance of loss, and&nbsp;<strong>peril</strong>&nbsp;is the direct cause of the loss. If a house burns down, then fire is the peril. A&nbsp;<strong>hazard</strong>&nbsp;is anything that either causes or increases the likelihood of a loss. For instance, gas furnaces are a hazard for carbon monoxide poisoning. A&nbsp;<strong>physical hazard</strong>&nbsp;is a physical condition that increases the possibility of a loss. Thus, smoking is a physical hazard that increases the likelihood of a house fire and illness.</p>

                        	<p><strong>Moral hazards</strong>&nbsp;are losses that results from dishonesty. Thus, insurance companies suffer losses because of fraudulent or inflated claims. The American legal system is a moral hazard in that it motivates many people to sue simply for financial profit because of the enormous amount of money that can sometimes be won, and because there is little cost to the plaintiff, even if he loses. A good example is the current asbestos litigation, which has bankrupted many companies, even though very few plaintiffs show any real evidence of disease, and are unlikely to ever develop any disease that can be shown, by the preponderance of the evidence, to have resulted from asbestos exposure. This type of moral hazard is often referred to as&nbsp;<strong>legal hazard</strong>. Legal hazard can also result from laws or regulations that force insurance companies to cover risks that they would otherwise not cover, such as including coverage for alcoholism in health insurance.</p>


                        	<p>Insurance can be regarded as a&nbsp;<strong>morale hazard</strong>&nbsp;because it increases the possibility of a loss that results from the insured worrying less about losses. Therefore, they take fewer precautions and may engage in riskier activities—because they have insurance. A good example of morale hazard is when the federal government bails out financial institutions who have made bad decisions. Many financial institutions have taken significant risks in the recent subprime debacle by buying toxic instruments, such as&nbsp;CDOs&nbsp;and&nbsp;mortgage-backed securities&nbsp;based on subprime mortgages that paid high yields, but were extremely risky. The financial institutions have considered themselves&nbsp;<strong>too big to fail</strong>—in other words, if things started going badly, then the federal government would step in to stop their collapse for fear that the whole financial system will collapse, which is exactly what the federal government did in September, 2008. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have both been taken over by the government, and American International Group (AIG) has been propped up by an infusion of $85 billion of taxpayers' money. AIG sold&nbsp;credit default swaps&nbsp;on mortgage-backed securities to buyers, mostly banks, thinking that they could collect the premiums, but would never have to actually to pay for defaults—but if they were wrong, then the government would save them, because otherwise the banks that had bought that credit default protection could also possibly fail. As recent events have demonstrated all too clearly, this federal government "insurance" creates a morale hazard for financial institutions—taxpayers pay the premium, but the big financial institutions, with their overpaid CEOs and managers, receive the benefits!</p>

                        		<p>The distinction between moral and morale hazard in insurance is one of intention, but in other disciplines, such as banking, the term&nbsp;<strong>moral hazard</strong>&nbsp;is used in a more general sense that includes morale hazard. Moral hazard is often applied to a receiver of funds, such as a borrower, and means that there is a risk that the receiver of funds will not use the money as was intended or that they may take unnecessary risks or not be vigilant in reducing risk. This definition includes not only intentional dishonesty, but also a change in behavior that results from using someone else's money, which, in insurance, would be described as morale hazard.</p>

                        		<p>Modern commerce was founded on the principle of ownership of property. When an asset loses value (by loss or destruction) due to a certain event, the owner of the asset suffers an economic loss. However if a common fund is created, which is made up of small contributions from many such owners of similar assets, this amount could be used to compensate the loss suffered by the unfortunate few.&nbsp;</p>

                        		<p>In simple words, the chance of suffering a certain economic loss and its consequence could be transferred from one individual to many through the mechanism of insurance.&nbsp;</p>

                        		<p><strong>Insurance may thus be considered as a process by which the losses of a few,&nbsp; who are unfortunate to suffer such losses, are shared amongst those exposed to similar uncertain events / situations.</strong></p>

                        		<p>There is however a catch here.</p>


                        		<ul>
									<li>Would people agree to part with their hard earned money, to create such a common fund?</li>
									<li>How could they trust that their contributions are actually being used for the desired purpose?</li>
								</ul>


								<p>Obviously someone has to initiate and organise the process and bring members of the community together for this purpose. That ‘someone’ is known as an ‘Insurer’ who determines the contribution that each individual must make to the pool and arranges to pay to those who suffer the loss.</p>


								<p>The insurer must also win the trust of the individuals and the community.</p>


								<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>How insurance works</p>



								<ul>
									<li>Firstly, these must be an asset which has an economic value. The&nbsp;<strong>ASSET</strong>:</li>
								</ul>

								<p>May be&nbsp;<strong>physical&nbsp;</strong>(like a car or a building) or</p>

								<p>May be&nbsp;<strong>non-physical&nbsp;</strong>(like name and goodwill) or</p>

								<p>May be&nbsp;<strong>personal&nbsp;</strong>(like one’s eyes, limbs and other aspects of one’s body)</p>


								<ul>
									<li>The asset may lose its value if a certain event happens. This chance of loss is called as&nbsp;<strong>risk</strong>. The cause of the risk event is known as&nbsp;<strong>peril</strong>.</li>
									<li>There is a principle known as&nbsp;<strong>pooling</strong>. This consists of collecting numerous individual contributions (known as premiums) from various persons. These persons have similar assets which are exposed to similar risks.</li>
									<li>This pool of funds is used to compensate the few who might suffer the losses as caused by a&nbsp;<strong>peril</strong>.</li>
									<li>This process of pooling funds and compensating the unlucky few is carried out through an institution known as the</li>
									<li>The insurer enters into an insurance&nbsp;<strong>contract&nbsp;</strong>with each person who seeks to participate in the scheme. Such a participant is known as</li>
								</ul>



									<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Insurance reduces burdens</p>

									<p>Burden of risk refers to the costs, losses and disabilities one has to bear as a result of being exposed to a given loss situation/event.</p>

									<p>Diagram 3: Risk burdens that one carries</p>

									<p>There are two types of risk burdens that one carries –&nbsp;<strong>primary and secondary</strong>.</p>

									<p><strong>a)&nbsp;</strong>Primary burden of risk</p>


									<p>The&nbsp;<strong>primary burden of risk&nbsp;</strong>consists of losses that are actually suffered by households (and business units), as a result of pure risk events. These losses are often direct and measurable and can be easily compensated for by insurance. When a factory gets destroyed by fire, the actual value of goods damaged or destroyed can be estimated and the compensation can be paid to the one who suffers such loss.&nbsp; If an individual undergoes a heart surgery, the medical cost of the same is known and compensated.</p>

									<p>In addition there may be some indirect losses.<br>
									A fire may interrupt business operations and lead to loss of profits which also can be estimated and the compensation can be paid to the one who suffers such a loss.&nbsp;</p>



									<p><strong>b)&nbsp;</strong>Secondary burden of risk</p>

									<p>Suppose no such event occurs and there is no loss. Does it mean that those who are exposed to the peril carry no burden? The answer is that apart from the primary burden, one also carries a secondary burden of risk.</p>



									<p>The&nbsp;<strong>secondary burden of risk&nbsp;</strong>consists of costs and strains that one has to bear merely from the fact that one is exposed to a loss situation. Even if the said event does not occur, these burdens have still to be borne.</p>



									<p>Let us understand some of these burdens:</p>

												<ul>
												<li>Firstly there is&nbsp;<strong>physical and mental strain caused by fear and anxiety</strong>. The anxiety may vary from person to person but it is present and can cause stress and affect a person’s</li>
												<li>Secondly when one is&nbsp;<strong>uncertain about whether a loss would occur or not</strong>, the prudent thing to do would be to set aside a reserve fund to meet such an eventuality. There is a cost involved in keeping such a fund. For instance, such funds may be held in a liquid form and yield low returns.</li>
											</ul>


											<p>By transferring the risk to an insurer, it becomes possible to enjoy peace of mind, invest funds that would otherwise have been set aside as a reserve, and plan one’s business more effectively. It is precisely for these reasons that insurance is needed.</p>
